And if you've ever seen a simple ray of sunlight plus a glass prism, you've seen how that combination lets us see all the colors of the visible spectrum hidden inside. Well, when a data scientist comes across some interesting new data and they want to get a deeper look, they've got a number of tools they reach for. Now this would be a great time for some background music, but I'm being told that that's not in the budget. Now Python, P-I-T-H-O-N, Python is probably the language most associated with data science, but it's not really Python itself providing these deep perspective shifting capabilities.

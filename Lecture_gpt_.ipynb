These are libraries that can help spot trends over time, gain insights into data, and maybe one day even solve the mystery of just why, 7, 8, 9. So today we're going to take a closer look at numpy and pandas. And if you've ever seen a simple ray of sunlight plus a glass prism, you've seen how that combination lets us see all the colors of the visible spectrum hidden inside. Well, when a data scientist comes across some interesting new data and they want to get a deeper look, they've got a number of tools they reach for. Now this would be a great time for some background music, but I'm being told that that's not in the budget. Now Python, P-I-T-H-O-N, Python is probably the language most associated with data science, but it's not really Python itself providing these deep perspective shifting capabilities. It's usually some sort of Python library which specializes in numerical and data processing and two of the biggest ones out \n"
